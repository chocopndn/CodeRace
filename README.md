# ITQuiz Race

**ITQuiz Race** is a fun and interactive quiz-based game designed to challenge players' coding knowledge. The game features two players: the human player and an AI opponent. Players answer questions related to programming concepts, and their car moves along a highway based on the number of correct answers they give. The goal is to reach the finish line first!

## Features

- A fast-paced quiz game where correct answers move your car on the highway.
- AI opponent that answers questions randomly.
- Leaderboard to track scores.
